The number $d_{1}d_{2}\dots d_{9}$ has nine (not necessarily distinct) decimal digits. The number $e_{1}e_{2}\dots e_{9}$ is such that each of the nine 9-digit numbers formed by replacing just one of the digits $d_{i}$ is $d_{1}d_{2}\dots d_{9}$ by the corresponding digit $e_{i}$ ($1 \leq i \leq 9$) is divisible by 7. The number $f_{1}f_{2}\dots f_{9}$ is related to $e_{1}e_{2}\dots e_{9}$ is the same way: that is, each of the nine numbers formed by replacing one of the $e_{i}$ by the corresponding $f_{i}$ is divisible by 7. Show that, for each $i$, $d_{i}-f_{i}$ is divisible by 7. [For example, if $d_{1}d_{2}\dots d_{9} = 199501996$, then $e_{6}$ may be 2 or 9, since $199502996$ and $199509996$ are multiples of 7.]
