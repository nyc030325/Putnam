A certain locker room contains $n$ lockers numbered $1,2,3,\cdots,n$ and all are originally locked. An attendant performs a sequence of operations $T_1,T_2,\cdots,T_n$ whereby with the operation $T_k$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, the condition of being locked or unlocked is changed for all those lockers and only those lockers whose numbers are multiples of $k$. After all the $n$ operations have been performed it is observed that all lockers whose numbers are perfect squares (and only those lockers) are now open or unlocked. Prove this mathematically.
