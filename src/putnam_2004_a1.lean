Basketball star Shanille O'Keal's team statistician keeps track of the number, $S(N)$, of successful free throws she has made in her first $N$ attempts of the season. Early in the season, $S(N)$ was less than $80\%$ of $N$, but by the end of the season, $S(N)$ was more than $80\%$ of $N$. Was there necessarily a moment in between when $S(N)$ was exactly $80\%$ of $N$?
