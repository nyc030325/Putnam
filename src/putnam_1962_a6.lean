Let $S$ be a set of rational numbers such that whenever $a$ and $b$ are members of $S$, so are $a+b$ and $ab$, and having the property that for every rational number $r$ exactly one of the following three statements is true: \[ r \in S, -r \in S, r = 0. \] Prove that $S$ is the set of all positive rational numbers.
