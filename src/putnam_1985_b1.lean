Let $k$ be the smallest positive integer for which there exist distinct integers $m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5$ such that the polynomial
\[
p(x) = (x-m_1)(x-m_2)(x-m_3)(x-m_4)(x-m_5)
\]
has exactly $k$ nonzero coefficients. Find, with proof, a set of integers $m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5$ for which this minimum $k$ is achieved.
